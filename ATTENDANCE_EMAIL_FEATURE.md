# Attendance Email Notification Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically sends email notifications to tutors when they successfully mark their attendance through the app or website.

## What's Included

### 1. Email Service Function
- **File**: `utils/emailService.js`
- **Function**: `sendAttendanceConfirmationEmail()`
- **Purpose**: Sends beautifully formatted HTML emails with attendance details

### 2. Updated Attendance Submission
- **File**: `controllers/tutorController.js`
- **Function**: `submitAttendance()`
- **Enhancement**: Now sends email notification after successful attendance submission

### 3. Test Route (Development Only)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/tutors/test-attendance-email`
- **Purpose**: Test the email functionality without marking actual attendance
- **Access**: Admin only

## Email Content

The email includes:
- ✅ **Confirmation Message**: Clear confirmation that attendance was recorded
- 📅 **Date**: Full date with day name (e.g., "Monday, January 15, 2024")
- ⏰ **Time**: Exact time when attendance was marked
- 🏫 **Center Name**: Name of the assigned center
- 📍 **Location Coordinates**: GPS coordinates where attendance was marked
- 🗺️ **Address**: Center address (if available)
- 📋 **Professional Formatting**: Clean, responsive HTML design

## How It Works

1. **Tutor marks attendance** via app/website
2. **System validates** location and saves attendance
3. **Email is sent automatically** to tutor's registered email
4. **Attendance submission continues** even if email fails (non-blocking)

## Configuration

### Email Settings (Already Configured)
```env
EMAIL_USER=noreplymtc.2025@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=vgnnxjhbzutrfity
```

### Email Service Provider
- **Service**: Gmail SMTP

## Testing the Feature

### Method 1: Test Route (Recommended for Development)
```bash
POST /api/tutors/test-attendance-email
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tutorId": "TUTOR_MONGODB_ID"
}
```

### Method 2: Actual Attendance Submission
```bash
POST /api/tutors/attendance
Authorization: Bearer <tutor_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "currentLocation": [28.6139, 77.2090]
}
```

## Error Handling

- **Email failures don't affect attendance submission**
- **Errors are logged** for debugging
- **Graceful fallback** if tutor email is not available
- **Detailed error logging** for troubleshooting

## Email Template Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern appearance
- **Emoji Icons**: Visual indicators for different information types
- **Color Coding**: Green theme for success/confirmation
- **Plain Text Fallback**: For email clients that don't support HTML

## Logs and Monitoring

The system logs:
- ✅ Successful email sends
- ❌ Email failures (with detailed error info)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- 📱 SMS notifications as backup
- 📈 Email delivery tracking
- 🔔 Push notifications for mobile app
- 📊 Email analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Email not received**:
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify tutor email in database
   - Check email service logs

2. **Email service errors**:
   - Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in .env
   - Check Gmail app password validity
   - Review server logs for detailed errors

3. **Attendance works but no email**:
   - This is expected behavior (non-blocking)
   - Check logs for email error details
   - Verify tutor has valid email address

### Log Locations:
- Console logs during development
- Server logs in production environment
- Email service specific logs in `emailService.js`

## Security Notes

- Email credentials stored in environment variables
- No sensitive attendance data exposed in emails
- Location coordinates rounded to 6 decimal places
- Professional email template prevents phishing concerns
